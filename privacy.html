Privacy Policy for Focus Mode Extension
Effective Date: [Enter Todayâ€™s Date]

1. Overview
The Focus Mode Chrome extension is designed to help users stay productive by hiding distracting content (such as YouTube comments, Twitter trends, etc.) from web pages. Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting your personal information.

2. Data Collection
We do NOT collect or transmit any personal data.

The extension:

Does not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information (PII).

Does not track browsing history, keystrokes, or any user activity beyond what is necessary to perform its intended function.

3. Permissions Explained
To function properly, the extension uses the following Chrome permissions:

scripting: Allows injecting code into the current tab when the user enables or disables Focus Mode.

storage: Used to save the toggle state (enabled/disabled) locally in your browser.

activeTab: Grants temporary access to the current tab when the user interacts with the extension popup.

These permissions are used strictly for implementing the core functionality of the extension and nothing more.

4. Data Storage
The extension only stores a simple on/off status (focusModeEnabled) in Chrome's local storage â€” on your own device. No data is sent externally or synced online.

5. Third-Party Services
The extension uses a Google Fonts link to load custom typography. No personal information is shared or collected through this.

6. Security
We take user trust seriously. The extension does not use or execute any remote scripts, ensuring that all logic is local and secure.

7. Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy in the future. Any updates will be reflected on this page with an updated effective date.
